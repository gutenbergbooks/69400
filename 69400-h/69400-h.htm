<h2 class="nobreak">Preface.</h2>
</div>


<p>There is an old Italian proverb, “See Naples and
die,” but the French paraphrase it in a more
pleasant way and say “See Paris and pray to live
there until the end of the world.” It is with some
of the females of Paris that we have to deal in
this little book. Life in the great Metropolis is
far different from the comparatively sober method
of living in our American cities. A well known
journalist says: “Men and women plunge into<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
the lovely city as into a bath of pleasure, buffet
with the breakers, float a brief time on the cosy
sea of life there, and are then sucked down in the
dark and sinister depths where ruin, disease and
death lay in wait for the prey they are sure of in
the end.” Of course this writer doesn’t mean that
all men and women get into the evil way, but he
does mean that a greater proportion are tempted
by evil in Paris than in any other place.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Jardin Mabille.</h2>
</div>


<p>The day of the Jardin Mabille went by several
years yet, but the memories of it remain. The
nearest approach to it, at present, is an establishment
in the Latin quarter of Paris. The Mabille
was a very elaborately and artistically arranged
garden, a maze of thickets, odorous with flowers.
It had an immense closed hall for winter use.
Here once a week was held a masked ball which
lasted from Saturday night to daybreak of the
Sabbath. The wickedest dances, notably the can-can
and the hula-hula, were invariably reserved
for the closing hours of the affair. The women
who frequented these balls were bad, yes, very
bad, and they were met there by men in all walks
of life. Even Napoleon III has visited this den of
iniquity incognito. The writer of this had occasion
to visit the Jardin Mabille and other similar
places in Paris once in company with a detective.<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
One of the notable dances seen was the bacchanal
or wine dance. It is accompanied with the most
astonishing sensational effects. The gas burns
low, loud gongs bray dismally, cymbals clash, and
the hall is brilliantly illuminated with red and blue
and green fires, amongst which pistols are discharged
and shrieks are heard in various parts of
the room. Never was a madder scene enacted in
real life than the bacchanal and the valentine on
New Year’s eve. But is it real life after all, or is
it only Paris and a kind of giddy dream? We,
who come only to look on and to renew our feeble,
but I trust virtuous, indignation at such sights,
turn at last from the girls in boys’ clothes and the
boy in girls’ clothes; from the jaunty sailor girl-boy
who has just ridden around the room on the
shoulders of her captain; from the Queen of Darkness
who swept past us in diamonds and sables
and never so much as suffered her languishing
eyes to rest for a moment on any one of us; from
the misery of the jealous one in the corner who
has been robbed of his prize, and the melancholy
of the two who are advising one another to go
home, for they have each had more than enough;
from all this we turn at last and find the streets
blank and cold, and over the roofs comes the
sound of bells that are calling the faithful to
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>As a resort the Jardin Mabille ranked about
with the Sixth Avenue dives of New York. The
general class of patrons were the same at both.
The attractions are the loose women; the attracted
the silly, young and old men.</p>

<p>I have encountered there grave American business
men and government officials, and famous
actresses and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donnæ</i>, bent on investigating
the gilded vice for which the Mabille has become
notorious. Indeed, the experience was said to be
one without which one’s knowledge of Paris was
incomplete, and as long as the Jardin Mabille
existed, it never lacked patrons to make its
sugared infamy profitable. God be thanked that
this vile institution is of the past, and it is our regret
that some French Parkhurst does not arise
and clean out the similar establishments whose
gilded doors are open as the reader is perusing this.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Ballet Dancers.</h2>
</div>


<p>The reader may be supposed to be familiar with
the architectural splendors of the Paris Opera
House. To some minds these splendors will perhaps
become more vivid when it is said that they
cost 40,000,000 francs, say $8,000,000. I omit all
general description and pass at once behind the
scenes to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foyer de la danse</i> or green-room of
the ladies of the ballet.</p>

<p>It is a splendid room, decorated with allegorical
panels and mirrors. All around the room run
bars fixed against the wall, and covered with red
velvet. The dancing “subjects” use these bars
to stretch and twist their legs, and to exercise
the muscles of their backs. Before the fireplace
stand the children and small fry of the ballet.
On each side of the fire, dozing and gossiping are
the mothers of the figurantes, armed with baskets
and knitting needles. In the middle of the room
is a little group of men, hats in hand, carefully
dressed, chatting, laughing, and apparently waiting
for something.</p>

<p>They are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitues</i>, and they are waiting for
the arrival of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers sujets</i>.</p>

<p>Soon these ladies appear, one by one, walking
with that movement of the hips that only dancers
have, the foot turned outward and enveloped in
loose gaiters, which make them look like Cochin<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
China hens. These gaiters are destined to preserve
their satin shoes and stockings from dust
and dirt. With a little watering-pot that they
carry with their finger tips, like shepherdesses in
Watteau’s pictures, they proceed to water about
three square feet of floor; then flinging into the
glass a general and collective ogle at the group
standing behind them, they go through a variety
of steps, pirouettes, smiles and capers for five
minutes.</p>

<p>Then comes a little repose. The group of men
breaks up, and those who are intimate enough
approach and talk to the dancers. What they
say to them is a secret. Meanwhile, the call man
cries with a voice like a rattle, “Gentlemen and
ladies, they are beginning.” This is not true. It
is like saying dinner at six for half past. The incident,
however, is useful to those ladies who wish
to cut short a tiresome conversation. The reply
is a caper.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the call man returns:
“Gentlemen and ladies, they have begun.”</p>

<p>This time it is almost true. Then the ladies
take off their gaiters, hand the watering-pots to
their mothers, to their chamber-maids, or to the
persons who combine these two offices, and with
much strutting and muscular mannerism direct
their steps toward the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Those who enjoy the privilege of the entry to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foyer</i> of the opera are the subscribers, the
Ministers, influential journalists, and a few other
persons whom it pleases the director to gratify.
All rich folk, you may be sure, for unless you are
rich you cannot be an habitue of the opera. As
Hector Berlioz used to say, “Music is essentially
aristocratic, a girl of noble lineage, that princes
alone can endow nowadays.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How Divided.</h2>
</div>


<p>And now let me say a few words about the
ladies of the ballet. They are divided into premiers,
sujets, coryphees, figurants and comparses.
I maintain the French terms for the simple reason
that there are no Anglo-Saxon equivalents.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de ballet</i>, like an army corps, is composed
of platoons, divided first of all according
to the sexes, and then into quadrilles, first and
second. The pay in the second quadrille is 700 to
800 francs a year; in the first, 900 to 1,000 francs;
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphee</i> gets 1,200, 1,300, or 1,400 francs. The
next stage is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sujet</i>, with an engagement of three
years and a salary beginning at 1,600 francs and
increasing up to 2,000 francs in the last year.</p>

<p>These are the stages through which the members
of the ballet of the opera pass. And what a
hard time they have! Take, for instance, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphees</i> and the members of the two quadrilles.<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
They arrive at the opera, say a quarter to 9 in the
morning, each armed with a leather bag, containing
a pair of stockings, some dancing shoes, a
corset, a chimisette, a comb, a hand mirror, a
button hook, a box of face powder, a piece of
bread, two sardines, some potatoes, and a bottle
containing more water than wine.</p>

<p>Each one climbs up to the fifth story and enters
a room, where her comrades of the quadrille are
dressing. In five minutes she has put on her class
costume—low necked chimisette, with short
sleeves, muslin skirt, rose-colored stockings,
shabby satin shoes, a blue ribbon round her neck,
and in her corset a bunch of brass medals, a piece
of red coral, and two little crosses. These are her
fetiches. No danseuse who respects herself can
do anything without her fetiches or lucky charms.</p>

<p>Up two more flights of stairs, she arrives in the
large square instruction room under the cupola,
with the floor slightly inclined to reproduce the
slope of the stage. The only furniture is a chair
for the teacher, Mme. Merante, a chair for the
violin player, Francois Merante, and all around
the room bars such as we have already seen in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foyer de la danse</i>.</p>

<p>“Take your places, young ladies!” cries Mme.
Merante. The girls place themselves at the bar, and
holding it now with the right hand and now with<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
the left, twist and dislocate their bodies in every
possible fashion. This is only a preparation for
the lesson proper. After these exercises, the
teacher calls the pupils into the middle of the
room, and then begin the figures and pirouettes.
If our heroine is ambitious, she will not be content
with the lesson alone, but undertake in a
corner by herself a number of intricate and peculiar
dislocations during the intervals of repose.</p>

<p>The lesson is over. It is 11 o’clock. The girls
hurry to their dressing-rooms to change their
linen, after which they breakfast in company on
sardines, radishes, sour apples, gossip and fried
potatoes. At noon the bell rings for rehearsal.
The girls have to come down on the stage, and
finish their breakfast while the stage manager
calls out the names and the ballet master talks to
the composer. The rehearsal drags along until 4
o’clock. Then the girls climb up again to their
dressing-room, put on their ordinary clothing,
and leave the theatre.</p>

<p>It is 5 o’clock by the time they reach their
homes, where their mothers, worthy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierges</i>
or washerwomen, are waiting for their daughters
to peel the potatoes for dinner. They have only
time to wash, to hurry through their dinner,
and return to the opera in time for the first act.
A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphee</i>, for instance, will play a page in the<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
first act, appear in the second, and take part in
the ballet in the third. During the fourth act she
remains in her dressing-room, and does a little
crochet, but hardly has she done a few points
before the call man’s voice is heard in the lobbies:
“Ladies, the fourth act is finished.” She changes
her costume, scampers down the stairs, and
rushes upon the stage. The curtain falls. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphee</i> regains her dressing-room, puts on her
ordinary clothes, and leaves the theatre. It is
nearly 1 o’clock when she reaches her home, and,
after eating a bit of bread and cheese while she
undresses, she creeps into her narrow bed. Her
day’s work is over.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Hard Labor for Girls.</h2>
</div>


<p>Indeed, there is but little poetry in the existence
of the smiling and light-footed dancers whose
pirouettes afford so much pleasure to the old gentlemen
in the orchestra stalls. They begin often
at the age of 5 or 6 in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">class des petites</i>, and
then every day in the year they practice and toil
and chatter and caper until from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rats</i> they become
successful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">figurantes</i> at the rate of one franc a
night, members of the first and second quadrilles,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphees</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sujets</i>. Then at the end of their
first three years’ engagement begins a period of
bitter grief. For then it often happens that, instead
of encouraging them and giving them a<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
decent salary, the administration of the opera
chooses its stars from among foreigners.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">A Borrowed Mother.</h2>
</div>


<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</i> always has a mother; if the fates
cut the thread of the days of her natural parent,
she will borrow, hire, or buy a new one. It is an
article of primary necessity. The mother holds
her daughter’s shawl in the wings, watches her
dance, covers her shoulders when her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas</i> is over,
and offers her a little bottle of cold beef tea to
quench her thirst and keep up her strength. Take
for a sample mother Mme. N., who begins her day
as a fruit seller at 6 o’clock in the morning. She
mounts into her little cart and trots off to the
Central Market, where she lays in her provision of
cabbages, turnips, carrots, and salads. Then, on
summer evenings, about 8 o’clock, a tall lackey
enters her shop, and Mme. N., dressed in her Sunday
best, gets into Mons. de P’s victoria and takes
a ride in the Bois de Boulogne with her daughter.
Mme. N. is a living encyclopædia, a gazette of
the market and of the court.</p>

charming French girls in tights. Each photograph
is mounted on a card and the lot of 40 card
photos makes an exquisite, unique and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i>

<h2 class="nobreak">Incident in a Dive.</h2>
</div>


<p>One day when the writer of this was visiting one
of the low dives of Paris, in company with a detective,
the latter said to him:</p>

<p>“Do you see that fellow at the third right-hand
table, reading a letter to a drunken woman? He
is an ex-lawyer’s clerk who has gone to the dogs
through strong drink. He hangs round pot-houses
and, for a drink, writes begging letters and bogus
letters of reference for customers. Every time he
is arrested for being drunk his pockets are full of
well-written notes, addressed to prominent people,
recommending meritorious cases of necessity to<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
their notice. The next table is occupied by two
prostitutes smoking cigarettes, and a couple of
sneaking blackguards who secretly sell obscene
pictures and transparent cards on the boulevards.
Still further on are a lot of the ‘bankers’ or hawkers,
who sell newspapers and pamphlets with
loud cries of ‘Last night’s murder!’ or ‘Frightful
scandal—full and minute particulars!’ Mixed in
with them are street singers, street musicians
and other Bohemians of the lowest class.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Unmasked.</h2>
</div>


<p>On receipt of 30 cents we will send, postpaid, a
large book entitled “Mabille Unmasked.” It tells
of the wickedest place in the world, how it was
started, who have patronized it, and what has
happened there. It is one of the greatest sensational
books of the age. A notable feature is that
it is full of pictures taken from life. Send 30 cents,
stamps, to U. S. Supply Co., Box 329, Lynn, Mass.
Another sensational book is entitled “Coney Island
Frolics.” It is profusely illustrated. Sent postpaid
for 30 cents by U. S. Supply Co.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Deep In Sin.</h2>
</div>


<p>At the entrance to the Rue de Trois Portes, the
writer made a sudden move. “Here’s a poor,
ragged woman lying stretched out on the sidewalk.
She looks as if she might be dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“Dead drunk,” responded the Chief of Detectives,
cynically. “Even animal life seems suspended.
Do you detect a very loathsome smell?
It is a combination of all the drinks and perfumes
popular among women of her kind. She is still
young—hardly thirty years old.” Between her
thick lips gleamed fine white teeth. She must
have been pretty at one time.</p>

<p>“How disgusting she looks, all plastered over
with mud.”</p>

<p>“She is what they call a ‘sidewalker.’”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It is the slang name for a class of prostitutes
whose only home is the scaffolding round some
old house that is being pulled down, or some new
one that is being built. They carry on their trade
in the open air under bridges, in the trenches of
the fortifications, in back alleys, where there are
no janitors. Once a week, regularly, this one
fetches up in the station-house. She comes lawfully
by her drunkenness. Her mother died in
hospital of delirium tremens. Her father committed
suicide while drunk. She herself has almost
got to the end of her rope. Some day,
coming out of a pot-house, she’ll drop dead in the
street, and then she’ll be on show, for the last
time, at the Morgue. Although known to thousands,
nobody will claim her body, and she will be
turned over to the medical school for dissection.”</p>

<p>“What was her parents’ business?”</p>

<p>“Her mother’s trade could not be classified.
Her father was a perambulating ‘fence,’ who
used to peddle stolen goods from door to door.”</p>

</div>


<p>A saloon called “The Senate” contained tables
almost touching each other, at which customers,
male and female, were packed like herrings in a
barrel.</p>

<p>The uproar was something indescribable. Some
were shouting, some were screaming, some were
reciting obscene verses. Five or six indecent
choruses were being sung at the same time.
Language of incredible foulness was roared from
one to another, shrieks of drunken laughter and
the crash of broken glass were incessant.</p>

<p>To overhear one’s neighbor, one had to bend his
ear right to his mouth. The solitary waiter,
sweating like a runaway horse, was in evil humor.
Woe to the man who stood in his way.</p>

<p>Everything was paid for in advance, and all
drinks cost 15 centimes (<span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> cents).</p>

<p>The decorations of this dive are its most remarkable
characteristic—for the paintings on the walls,
which were singularly well executed, were filthy
and obscene beyond description. Human beings,
male and female, were represented, life size, engaged
in performances and operations which are
never mentioned even among savages.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
